                    <p>From a very young age, I've had a passion for technology and a flair for expressing myself artistically. When I wasn't assembling personal computers for the fun of it, I was teaching myself new instruments and learning my favorite songs by ear. So far, I've taught myself guitar, drums, bass and piano, and have performed at venues across the southeast. Naturally, I dove right into music production and audio engineering. Through learning the in's and out's of different digital audio workstations, I believe this is where I first developed a deep appreciation for beautiful interfaces and a seamless user experience. <br><br>During the advent of blockchain, I became absolutely obsessed with the idea of decentralized currency, as well as blockchain's implications regarding the tokenization of music, art, real estate, etc. Because of my love for assembling and optimizing computers, I began building mining rigs to contribute to and support various digital asset networks. Around that time, I became increasingly fascinated with the software that giant tech companies and startups alike were utilizing - and they all seemed to have the most interesting and dynamic websites. On a whim, I started teaching myself Python 2 (honestly, I just thought it had a cool name so I went for it) and absolutely fell in love, just like I had with the hardware side of computers as a child.

                    I'm currently attending the full-stack web development program at Georgia Tech to continue honing my skills - not just to become employer ready, but to be employer competitive. I'm ecstatic to continue learning and to leverage my technical experience and artistic nature into a fulfilling career as a fully fledged web developer!
