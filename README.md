This is my portfolio! 

I did my best to duplicate the example given in the instructions, although I did take some artistic liberties such as navbar buttons with hover effects and hover reveal/opacity for my portfolio projects. I also added some extra margin at the bottom to show that the footer is, indeed, sticky.

I had a blast making this and I look forward to continue working on it.

“Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.
It matters that you don't just give up.”
